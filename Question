  Multiclass classification
In this problem, you will build a classifier to recognize handwritten digits(28*28) in the dataset.
As you know, the KNN algorithm is a multi-class classifier by nature. On the other hand, the SVM algorithm is two-class and cannot be used in the initial state to solve multi-class problems.
In this problem, you will solve this deficiency in the SVM algorithm by implementing the one-vs-one technique.
*** we can use of ovo and ovr classifier ***
*** we can make confusion matrix ***
*** we should Transpose the matrxi of pixel ***
